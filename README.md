# Microsoft-Clone-HTML-CSS-Project
This is a basic front-end project : a clone of microsoft homepage. It is built using HTML, CSS and Font Awesome icons. I created this project as a part of my learning after completing basic HTML, CSS. Currently it is desktop first. Responsive version and more improvements will be added soon.
